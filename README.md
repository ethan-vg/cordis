# Cordis

Cordis is a Discord bot that adds additional functionality for tightly-knit to very large, public Discord servers.

Note that Cordis is Discord, but flipped! Clever, eh?

## Rationale

Cordis is my first, full-scale project, but not my first Discord bot. Cordis, however, is my first (to be) full-scale Discord bot.
